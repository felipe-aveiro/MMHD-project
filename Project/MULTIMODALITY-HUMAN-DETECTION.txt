✅ Fine-tuning Parameter:

    📦 epochs = 50

        🧠 What it does:
            Specifies the number of times the model will go through the entire training dataset.
            Higher values allow the model to learn more — but can lead to overfitting if excessive.

        📌 Importance for fine-tuning:
            Very high — this controls how much the model adapts to your custom dataset.

        📈 Typical tuning values:

            Small datasets: 50–200 epochs

            Large datasets: depends on compute resources and training time

        ✅ Yes, you can change this later. Just modify the value and re-run the training:

            python
                model.train(epochs=100, ...)
    
    📦 YOLO('yolov8s.pt')

        🧠 What it does:
            This loads a pre-trained YOLOv8 model architecture with pretrained weights (.pt file).
            In this case: YOLOv8s → "small" version of the model.

        📌 Importance for fine-tuning:
            Critical. You’re initializing the model with weights learned from the COCO dataset — meaning the model already has some understanding of object detection.

        🧬 This is the starting point for fine-tuning — you’ll then adapt it to your custom dataset (e.g., thermal or RGB humans only).

        📊 Available Model Sizes:
        
            Model	        Size	Speed	         Accuracy	         Use Case

            yolov8n.pt	    nano	🟢 Fast	        🔴 Low	            Real-time or edge devices
            yolov8s.pt	    small	🟢 Fast	        🟡 Medium	        Balanced use cases
            yolov8m.pt	    medium	🟡 Medium	    🟢 Good	            More accurate, slower
            yolov8l.pt	    large	🔴 Slow	        🟢 High	            Heavy training, better accuracy
            yolov8x.pt	    x-large	🔴 Very slow	🟢 Best	            Research or high-end training

        ✅ You can switch models easily:

            python
                model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # if you want speed
                model = YOLO('yolov8m.pt')  # if you want more accuracy

                        yolov8n.pt (nano)	        yolov8s.pt (small)

            Speed	    ⚡ Fastest	               🔄 Fast
            Size	    💾 Tiny (~3.2MB)	        📦 Small (~11MB)
            Accuracy	❗ Lower	                    ✅ Better than nano
            Ideal for	Real-time, embedded	         Desktop, quick protos

            ** yolov8n is less accurate, so for proof of concept/benchmarks,
            you may still want to compare yolov8n vs yolov8s performance side-by-side.

    📦 patience=num_epochs

        🧠 What it does:
            Controls early stopping — training will stop if validation loss doesn’t improve after patience epochs.

        📌 Why it matters:
            Setting patience = num_epochs disables early stopping.
            This ensures the model trains for the full number of epochs, regardless of performance.

        ❗  Recommendation:
            ✅ Good as-is while experimenting. You can lower later if overfitting starts.
    
    📦 pretrained=False

        🧠 What it does:
            If False: fine-tunes from scratch using the weights in 'yolov8n.pt' (learned from COCO).
            If True: resumes training from a previous fine-tuned model (runs/.../weights/best.pt).

        📌 Why it matters:
            Setting False means you’re doing transfer learning from generic COCO weights.
            If you already trained before and want to continue — set to True.

        ❗  Recommendation:
            ✅ Leave it as False for your first full training.
    
    📦 imgsz=640

        🧠 What it does:
            Sets the image resolution used during training (images will be resized to this).

        📌 Why it matters:
            Lower values → faster training, but potentially less accurate.
            Higher values → slower, but potentially better detection (especially for small objects).

        🔄 Tradeoff:
            416 for real-time focus
            640 (default) is balanced
            768+ if you need fine-grained detection

        ❗  Recommendation:
            ✅ Stick with 640 for now. You can test others later during tuning.
